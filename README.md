# composable-rss-engine

composable-rss is a multi-user, self-hosted platform that allows you to programmatically create, publish, and manage syndicated web feeds.

This repository contains the Engine server, which is a submodule of composable-rss-app. The engine is responsible for running periodically executing jobs, such as feed expiration/archival and scheduled deployment.
